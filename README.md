# Bubblesort-Algodynamics
I have learnt elm by starting with implementation of 
bubble sort experiment Replica. This helped me 
learn to model a problem in ELM and understand 
language constructs, architecture of ELM. My 
implementation has the fol- lowing features:
1. Displays and Updates state variables namely 
index(i) and boundary(b) of bubble sort 
Experiment.
2. Highlights elements with green color if they are in 
the correct position when compared with sorted 
Array.
3. Reset button to reset the machine to initial state.
4. Undo button to undo the previous operation.
5. Status string which displays array status i.e sorted or
not sorted
6. Swap button to swap consecutive elements.
7. Index highlighter which highlights indices of two 
elements which are going to be swapped.
